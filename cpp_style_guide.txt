# C++ style guide 
We use google's c++ style guide (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) for the most part. The places where we differ are documented below:

1) Instance/Member variables should being with "m_". It works with intellisense better as you are trying to use the member variables.

2) Variable names (parameters, local function variables, instance variables should use camelCase instead of snake_case)

3) Struct variable are named exactly like class variables except that they don't have "m_" prefix.

4) Prefer using C++ headers for C functions and types e.g. prefer <cstring> over <string.h>, <cstdint> over <stdint.h> etc.
