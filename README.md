## JonoonDB
Database for developers by developers.

JonoonDB is a persistent document store written in C++. It is currently under active development. The key features will include:

* State of the art indexing technology.
* Speed.
* Modular design. We can't claim to be the database for the developers if JonoonDB is not hackable. You can provide custom implementations for the core components in the database.
* SQL support for querying documents.
